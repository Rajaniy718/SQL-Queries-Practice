The summary statistics to perform for each of the columns in the dataset would depend on the type of data each column contains. 
Here's a general guideline for which summary statistics to calculate for different types of data:

Categorical Columns (e.g., scheme_name, fund_manager, amc_name, rating, category, sub_category, risk_level):

Count: Count of unique categories or values.
Mode: Most frequently occurring category or value.
Frequency distribution: A table showing the count or percentage of each category.

Numeric Columns (e.g., min_sip, min_lumpsum, expense_ratio, fund_size_cr, fund_age_yr, alpha, sd, beta, sharpe, returns_1yr, returns_3yr, returns_5yr):

Mean (Average): To understand the central tendency.
Median: To identify the middle value.
Standard Deviation: To measure the spread or dispersion.
Minimum and Maximum: To identify the range of values.
Quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles): To understand data distribution and identify outliers.
Percentiles (e.g., 10th, 90th): To examine specific percentiles if needed.
Skewness and Kurtosis: To assess the shape and symmetry of the distribution.
Count (Number of non-null values): To check for missing data.
